# SDK 0.9.4

Run saved packages from tested runtimes 0.7.0 and 0.7.1 without saving replacement Methods. Record the actual executor version and require that exact version before resuming unfinished work, including before SDK setup and shared-state access. Completed results can still be uploaded after an upgrade. Clarify connection access and operation order in the execution guide; keep the complete one-shot unchanged.

# SDK 0.9.3

Select the calling agent without a machine-wide remembered preference. Ask for a choice when the caller is unclear and both agents are available. Keep the selected profiles when a run resumes, and reject checkpoints that have lost that selection. An explicit --agent selects unconfigured profiles ahead of the configured default.

# SDK 0.9.2

Keep the complete daily briefing one-shot in `method authoring`, with its recorded request, YAML Method, and full approved report in order. Remove report-specific instructions from the general guide and edit history from the example. Declare the writer's source check in the Method and keep sample inputs separate from saved files. Include the new sample run and its actual output.

# SDK 0.9.1

Include the declared runtime.json in the installed daily briefing example. Check all declared example files in the packed release.

# Changes

## 0.9.0

Use method/3.1 and the current runtime. Removed old format conversion, runtime-version dispatch, old account credential lookup, Builder report payloads, ZIP result payloads, and old example document parsing. The installer installs the current release.
